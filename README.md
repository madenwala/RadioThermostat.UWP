# RadioThermostat.UWP
This solution represents the Windows 10 application represented within the Microsoft Store. I've open sourced the application and welcoming anyone who wants to enhance the application.

This application is built with the [RadioThermostat.Api](https://github.com/madenwala/RadioThermostat.Api) library. Any improvements to the API can be made on it's own GitHub project.
